#SIP Sample
SIP is the short name for Session Initiation Protocol, which is the protocal for network call.
This sample is based on the Android official sample.

Android provide the sip interface to make the SIP in android more easily been used for developer,
but we have to register a SIP account first which we can get from the free [SIP provider](http://www.linphone.org/free-sip-service.html).

Next, setup this app easily in AndroidStudio, and you can make it works.
